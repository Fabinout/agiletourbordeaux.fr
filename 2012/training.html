			<h3>Training:</h3>
			<h5>Short description:</h5>
			This interactive, workshop-style training course gives you practical insight into the nature and principles of testing in an agile context.

			<h5>What do you expect participants to get out of this session?</h5>
			On completion of this course you will understand the importance of testing in agile projects and have practical exposure to the key practices that successful agile teams use to assure quality.

			<h5>Who will benefit from this session?</h5>
			Business analysts, product owners, developers and testers.

			<h5>Description:</h5>
			This tutorial introduces the key principles of agile development with a particular focus on the quality and testing aspects. We illustrate why agile projects present a radical shift from traditional ‘waterfall’ project plans and divisions of labour, and show why this requires a complete rethink of the way software is tested. We explain what it means for a project to be truly ‘test-driven’, where the testers take a ‘lead’ rather than a ‘lag’ role in the development cycle. You will learn how to use different testing techniques to provide complementary risk mitigation and test coverage on agile projects. The tutorial also gives you exposure to some open-source testing tools popular in agile teams, such as FitNesse.

			<h3>Topics covered include:</h3>
			<h5>Agile Testing Strategies</h5>
			Discussion of the process patterns for a successful agile testing strategy. Includes team structures, testing quadrants, TDD, QA activities in the iteration, exploratory testing, defect triage.
			This is a recommended basic module.
			 
			<h5>Introducing Test-Driven Development</h5>
			Exercise to demonstrate TDD principles and highlight the sequence of activities used to drive the implementation of a feature from tests, beginning with story brief, rules & criteria, test design, test automation, implementation and refactoring. Compares key differences between Unit-, Acceptance- and Behaviour-Driven Development (TDD, ATDD, BDD).
			This is a recommended basic module.
			 
			<h5>Illustrating with Examples</h5>
			Introduction to the concept of Specification by Example. Participants learn the basic elements of running a Specification Workshop to understand stories and explore testable examples to document and drive the implementation.
			 
			<h5>Specification by Example</h5>
			Examines the key process patterns of Specification by Example, showing how an agile Story specification evolves through the delivery pipeline.
			 
			<h5>Client Domain Specification Workshop</h5>
			Participants apply practices of agile acceptance testing by running a Specification Workshop on real stories from their own domain. The client selects stories to work on prior to the course. Suggested pre-requisite module is “Specification by Example”.
			 
			<h5>From Stories to Tests</h5>
			How to decompose high level requirements into small, independently valuable stories with explicit acceptance criteria and testable example scenarios. Uses practical exercises with realistic requirements.
			 
			<h5>Living Documentation</h5>
			How to get long-term value from acceptance tests as useful, self-checking living documentation of your system. Naming and structuring tests; organising and refactoring large test suites.
			 
			<h5>Tools Overview</h5>
			Introduction to the most popular tools for agile automated acceptance testing. Participants learn the basics of FitNesse, Concordion, Cucumber and Selenium through a quick demonstration of each tool and a comparison of equivalent tests.
			 
			<h5>Lean Software Testing</h5>
			Deeper exploration of Lean principles and how they apply to testing strategy and process. Discussion of the concepts of eliminating waste, building quality in, and improving flow.
